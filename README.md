# Albreakdo

My program is a brick-break style game that teaches the user important fundamental concepts in the field of environmental science relating to albedo and climate change.

Mechanics still missing:

- Pause menu, reset button, game over
- Breakable blocks each with own color
- Breaking a color brick with the same color ball adds more time to timer
- Some breakable blocks will represent greenhouse gas blocks
- Greenhouse blocks that are destroyed speed up the timer

### In Development

> kivy installation: 'conda install kivy -c conda-forge' -- otherwise see instructions at https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html


> git clone https://github.com/lili4127/AlbreakdoGame.git


> cd ./Albreakdo/src


> python main.py (for now. once game is completed it will be deployed, downloaded, and run so no pip install)


#### Kivy documentation to clarify code can be found here: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/
#### This game is was built upon the foundation of kivy's pong tutorial which is explained here: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html
