emText = '''The electromagnetic spectrum represents the range of types \
of Electromagnetic radiation. Radiation is energy that can travel and \
spread. For example, visible light from a lamp, and radio waves from a radio \
station, are 2 types of electromagnetic radiation. The types of radiation \
that make up the EM spectrum are: X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, \
and microwave. Each type can be shorter or longer. X-rays represent \
the short side of the spectrum and microwaves representing the long side. \
Infrared (long) wavelengths are emitted by the Earth, while shorter and \
more energetic wavelengths of visible light come from the sun.'''

sunText = '''The majority of energy that the Sun emits is in the visible \
part of the electromagnetic spectrum. When the Sun's light (in the form of \
shortwave radiation) reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back into \
space as shortwave radiation, while the rest is absorbed. Absorbed energy \
warms the Earth's surface and is emitted by the planet as longer (infared) \
wavelengths through ​blackbody radiation​. Collectively, this process of \
absorption, reflection and reemission establishes a ​global energy balance​ \
which is fundamental to Earth’s climate system.'''

albedoText = '''Albedo is a term used in planetary science which refers to \
reflection. It represents the part of incoming radiation that is returned \
from the surface of a target. It is calculated with the formula: albedo = \
(reflected solar radiation) / (incoming solar radiation). The Earth's albedo \
is roughly 30 percent, meaning 30 percent of incoming radiation hitting \
the Earth’s surface is being reflected and not absorbed. This reflection \
is mainly thanks to the clouds that Earth has in its atmosphere.'''


colorsText = '''Albedo can differ between clouds and land-surfaces \
(such as ice and sand) by color. White is the most reflective and studies \
have shown that reflectivity decreases as colors get darker. Looking at the \
colors: white, tan, green, and blue (which can represent properties of \
Eath's surface such as snow, sand, grass, and water) reflectivity decreased \
in that order. This is a crucial because as polar ice caps begin to melt \
due to climate change, the Earth is losing valuable reflective material such \
as snow. Since sand, grass, and the ocean are less reflective, the surface \
will end up absorbing more radiation which increases the heat of our planet.'''

gassesText = '''A phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect also contributes \
to the warming of our planet. A greenhouse gas is defined as a gas that \
significantly absorbs infrared (IR) radiation (which is exactly what is \
emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere). Gasses live in our atmosphere and \
once a gas absorbs radiation it reemitts it in all directions. This further \
warms the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere. Two of the most \
important gasses that are part of the greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide \
(CO2) and methane (CH4). They are created through the burning of fossil \
fuels (such as coal and oil), and the more humans continue to use them, \
the more gas fills the atmosphere to trap Earth's emitted IR radiation. \
This creates a feedback loop where radiation is captured and re-emitted in \
the atmosphere, ice melts lowering reflectivity, absorption and emission \
increases, and the cycle begins again. Eventually this loop can warm the \
planet to a point where life may struggle to survive.'''
